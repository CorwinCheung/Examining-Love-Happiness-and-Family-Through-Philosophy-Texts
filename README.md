Term: Fall 2021

+ Project title: Examining Love, Happiness, and Family through philosophy text data

+ Project summary: This data examined the relationship between family, love, and happiness though statistical analysis, data mining, and visualization of the history of philosophy dataset, available for download at https://www.kaggle.com/kouroshalizadeh/history-of-philosophy. Specifically this data story looked at how each of our three topics: family, love, and happiness, are related to each other through word embeddings, sentiment analysis and illustrative word clouds. This story also included basic information and visualization about the dataset to familiarize the reader before we explore deeper. This data story also explore how much these three topics are mentioned in the data and which philosophers speak about these topics of interest. Results incuded top authors of love, family and happiness: Beauvoir, Marcus Aurelius, Davis and Wollstonecraft. Most important words for each topic through wordclouds and word embedddings. we can see that the most important terms for each topic are ... ... ... for love, ... ... ... for family, and ... ... ... for happiness. Further, the story used and trained a word embedding on this data to see that these words are interconnected to each other. Through these analysis methods, we learned about love, family, and happiness, who wrote about them and how much they were written about, which words were the most important to these topics, and how this words and topics are related through word embeddings.
